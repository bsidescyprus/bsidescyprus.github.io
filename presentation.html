                <hr class="divider" />
				
				<p>Exposed secrets like API keys and other credentials are the crown jewels of organizations but continue to be a persistent vulnerability within security. This presentation sheds light on the various methods used by attackers to discover and exploit these secrets in different technologies. This manual will include how to:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Abuse GitHub public API</li>
					<li>Gain unauthorized access to private git repos</li>
					<li>Decompile containers</li>
					<li>Decompile mobile applications from the App and Play Stores</li>
				</ul>

				<p>We combine novel research, real-life attack paths, and live demos to prove exactly the steps attackers take, revealing their playbook.</p>

				<p>Recent research has shown that git repositories are treasure troves full of secrets. A year-long study showed that 10 million secrets were pushed into public repositories in 2022 alone. We will show exactly how adversaries abuse the public GitHub API to uncover these secrets, and also demonstrate how to gain unauthorized access to private git repositories. This talk will also dive into research showing how common it is to find secrets in containers like docker images and even mobile applications. Finally, we will do a live demo of how attackers can easily break apart these technologies to uncover hidden jewels.</p>

                <hr class="divider" />
				
				<p>Financial institutions are grappling with an alarming rise in cyber threats, resulting in a surge of fraud and financial crimes. While some Threat Actors (TAs) concentrate on workstation banking trojans suited for corporate environments, others exploit Android banking trojans for retail fraud.</p>

				<p>Our presentation delves into the methodologies and confirmed instances of two primary fraud operations behind Ramnit and Ursnif. We explore Automatic Transfer Systems (ATS) utilizing an innovative web injection kit (drIBAN) to acquire fresh money mules, manipulate legitimate banking transfers, and veil activities. Additionally, we investigate the Account Takeover (ATO) technique, capitalizing on human vulnerabilities through Social Engineering and malware capabilities.</p>

				<p>ATS and ATO techniques have emerged as standard practices in modern fraud operations, allowing TAs to adapt their approaches continually. Our comprehensive analysis offers multifaceted insights, encompassing technical nuances, a comparative assessment of Ramnit and Ursnif fraud models, and the introduction of potential countermeasures to mitigate infection risks and safeguard users.</p>

				<p>As the cyber threat landscape evolves, maintaining vigilance and being equipped with knowledge and tools is imperative for financial institutions to combat sophisticated banking fraud. Our presentation is designed to empower attendees with critical insights and proactive strategies for defending against these prevalent cyber threats.</p>

                <hr class="divider" />
				
				<p>If the company is rapidly growing, it is hard to maintain proper security automation scanning in all of its parts. The Security Bot is the solution that can help. Powered by open-source tools, it allows us to provide 100% coverage for the company's projects out of the box. If a specific configuration is required, there are still options to make it custom. These changes can be easily achieved by editing a configuration file that looks as friendly as an ordinary working email message. Multiple workers in parallel allow us to cover huge companies without any problems or restrictions.</p>

				<p>Project is already available at <a href="https://github.com/exness/security-bot" target="_blank">Github</a>, and a new version is about to be published by the end of September.</p>

				<hr class="divider" />
				
				<p>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities have been around for a long time, and they still pose a significant threat to web applications, so much so this kind of vulnerability has been included in OWASP TOP 10. This type of attack allows an attacker to send unauthorized requests from a vulnerable application, which can lead to data leakage, server-side request smuggling, and even full-scale remote code execution.</p>

				<p>In this technical talk, we will explore the concept of SSRF attacks and how easy it is for developers to introduce these vulnerabilities into their code. We will delve into the technical details of SSRF, looking at some of the most common attack scenarios and how they can be exploited.</p>

				<p>To make this talk more practical, we will also perform a live coding demonstration of all the techniques discussed.</p>

				<p>At the end of this talk, attendees will have a better understanding of SSRF attacks, how they work, and how to protect their Go applications from them. They will also have a clear idea of the various tools and techniques available to mitigate SSRF risks, making it harder for attackers to exploit these vulnerabilities.</p>

				<hr class="divider" />
				
				<p>Society increasingly relies on mobile phones for a range of essential services, including banking, shopping, and work-related tasks. Because of that, cybercriminals have noticed a shift of users from desktop to mobile, becoming aware of the burgeoning opportunities to exploit this trend for their own gains.</p>
				
				<p>With a focus on financial gains, threat actors (TAs) have developed sophisticated Android banking trojans, evolving from intercepting SMS messages to executing complex Automatic Transfer System (ATS) attacks.</p>
				
				<p>During the last years, collaborating with high-level financial institutions, we observed a major spike of malicious applications on mobile devices. TAs from all over the world are taking advantage of this digital transformation due to the rapidly increasing volume of digital transactions and the availability of fresh targets.</p>
				
				<p>The presentation will delve into modern Android banking trojans, illustrating evolving tactics such as SMS-stealer to fully-armed RATs like TeaBot, PixPirate, and SharkBot. It will explore techniques for banking fraud, 2FA bypass, and defense evasion. Additionally, the talk will cover the latest social engineering and sideloading strategies employed to distribute trojans, even through the official Google Play Store. Real-world examples from incident response cases will dissect current attack methodologies and tactics, shedding light on this escalating threat landscape.</p>

				<hr class="divider" />
				
				<p>C2 servers of mobile and Windows malware are usually left to their own fate after they have been discovered and the malware is no longer effective. We are going to take a deep dive into the rabbit hole of attacking and owning C2 servers, exposing details about their infrastructure, code bases, and the identity of the companies and individuals that operate and profit from them.</p>
				
				<p>While understanding and reversing malware is a highly skilled procedure, attacking the C2 itself rarely requires a lot of technical skills. Most of the C2 servers have the same typical HTTP problems that can be detected by off-the-shelf vulnerability scanners.</p>
				
				<p>By exploiting low-hanging fruit vulnerabilities, an attacker can obtain unauthorized access to administrative functions, allowing them to command thousands of devices and further explore other attack vectors. This can give them access to administrator panels and malware source code, and result in the identity of threat actors being exposed.</p>

At the same time, such security awareness activities could have multiple goals - learning, raising awareness level, raising security brand, and others. That's why there could be different activities for each goal.</p>

				<p>In this presentation, I will share the experience of conducting an event called "Security week." For almost 10 years, we have organized such an event and every year, we have experimented with the formats, tried some new ones, developed our own types, and each time, we have analyzed our success.</p>

				<p>As a result, I'd like to share about 10 different formats with pros and cons of each, which could help security teams in companies to avoid our mistakes and to get new ideas for implementation.</p>
