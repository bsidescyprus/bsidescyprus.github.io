				<br>

				<p>Vangelis began as a developer from Greece. Six years ago he realized that only his dog didn’t have an API, so he decided to steer his focus towards security.</p>

				<p>That led him to pursue a PhD in Web Application Security with an extra focus on machine learning. He’s still actively pursuing it.</p>

				<p>He currently applies his skills as a Chief Technology Officer at Tremau, and during his free time, Vangelis is helping start-ups secure themselves on the internet and get a leg up in security terms.</p>

				<p>His love of a simplistic approach to hacking by exploiting vulnerable APIs led him to publish research regarding API controlling ships, smart locks, IP cameras, car alarms, EV chargers, and many other IoT devices.</p>

				<p>Since our lives are nowadays extremely cyber-dependent, his goal is to convince all companies to never neglect their API security as rush-to-market mentality is almost certain to lead to catastrophic security failure.</p>

				<p>As a Senior Threat Hunter and member of a global Managed Detection and Response (MDR) team within WithSecure (F-Secure), I'm expected to guide and advise my colleagues during cyber incidents.</p>

				<p>My daily routine as a front-line worker involves a lot of research, detection engineering, threat hunting, and knowledge base improvements. The aforementioned tasks bring value to WithSecure's global service and improve customers' cyber security posture and awareness.</p>

				<p>I take part in post-incident improvement best practices that help us analyze attacking techniques in-depth to build better detection coverage, which will decrease the dwell time of our response.</p>

				<p>On top of my technical duties, I assist during the recruitment process, facilitate the onboarding sessions, and coach our new fellows.</p>

				<p>Before joining WithSecure's global Threat hunting team, I was conducting various offensive security operations as a Penetration Tester in Deloitte Cyprus, which helped me develop an out-of-the-box mindset.</p>

				<p>I'm constantly seeking ways to contribute to the cyber security community through conference talks, blogging, and my personal GitHub repository. In my free time, I like to read books, travel, and explore Poland.</p>
